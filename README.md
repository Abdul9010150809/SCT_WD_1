## 📖 About the Project

Skillcraft is a one-page responsive website that features a rich UI, clean navigation, and accessibility features like speech synthesis and dark mode toggle. The content introduces internship details, key learning features, and dummy links that simulate a full learning platform.

It’s an ideal showcase of frontend development skills — all built into a single index.html file.
